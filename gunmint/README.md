🔫 GUNMINT: Decentralized Asset Foundry

The Steam Community Market for the Mobile Gaming Era.
Built on Solana. Powered by State Compression (cNFTs).


🚀 The Problem

In the current Web2 gaming landscape (PUBG, Free Fire, COD Mobile), Indian gamers spend billions on skins they do not own.

❌ Zero Liquidity: You cannot sell a skin once bought.

❌ Siloed Assets: A skin in Game A cannot be used in Game B.

❌ High Fees: Marketplaces take 30% cuts.

⚡ The Solution: GUNMINT

GunMint is the liquidity layer for in-game assets. We allow gamers to:

Forge: Design skins using our on-chain SVG Texture Engine.

Mint: Create assets as Compressed NFTs (cNFTs) for <$0.001.

Integrate: Game devs use our Unity SDK to load these skins into actual mobile games.

🛠️ Key Features

1. Advanced Gun Foundry 🎨

Unlike static image uploads, our engine uses Vector Pattern Mapping.

5 Weapon Classes: Sniper, AR, SMG, Shotgun, Pistol.

Texture Layers: Carbon Fiber, Dragon Scales, Digital Camo.

Assembly Animation: Weapons mechanically assemble using CSS transitions.

2. Solana State Compression (cNFTs) 💎

We use Metaplex Bubblegum to make asset trading viable for micro-transactions.

Cost to Mint: 0.00005 SOL (~$0.01).

Speed: 4,000 TPS (Transactions Per Second).

Scalability: Mint millions of skins without clogging the network.

3. Mobile-First Architecture 📱

Built for the "Next Billion Users" on mobile.

Responsive Design: Touch-optimized UI.

Okto Wallet Ready: Designed for embedded wallet integration (no seed phrases).
